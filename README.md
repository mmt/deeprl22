# Deep Reinforcement Learning Study Group

This repository is a clone of the Spring 2017 deep reinforcement
learning [class](http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/) at Berkeley.
We've cloned it for the purpose of having a collaborative study group
watching the lectures and working on the problem sets.

# Resources.
## Lecture Material

- Google's deep learning Udacity [course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) seems like a good introduction.

- Professor Bertsekas's Dynamic Programming [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiCLbsFQNFAxOmVeqPhI5er1LGf2-L9I4) seem like a good supplement to these lectures.

## Papers

- Yann Lecun's [paper](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98b.pdf) discusses
  tricks for normalization and initialization.

## Blog Posts etc.

- A [post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) describing RNNs.
- A [post](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) explaining LSTMs.
- A pair of posts on [seq2seq](https://indico.io/blog/sequence-modeling-neuralnets-part1/)
  and [attention](https://indico.io/blog/sequence-modeling-neuralnets-part1/).

## Software

### Tensorflow

- [Tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mandelbrot)

- [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/summaries_and_tensorboard) seems like a good way to instrument training algorithms.

- [Supervisor](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/supervisor)

- [Threading and queues](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/threading_and_queues)

- [TF Slim](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/slim) might save time.

### Other

- [Pudb](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pudb) seems like a useful debug tool.

## Other courses
- [Stanford CS class CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.github.io) - another class more focused on convnets
